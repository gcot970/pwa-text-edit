# Text Editor App

## Description
This is an editor application based off of J.A.T.E. that is based off of PWA. This allows for installation in Chromium-based browsers and offline access. This allowed me to practice both concurrent servers, bundling, and offline access of custom web-based applications.


## Installation

This project requires the installation of:
 - Node.js
 - NPM
 - Express.js
 - if-env
 - concurrently
 - nodemon
